============================
Extreme low bit rate vocoder
============================

This code is from a 2011 hackathon, and it REQUIRES Matlab DSP Toolbox for Cepstral coefficients to LPC conversion.
Such methods are commonly known and may even be around in Octave/Python code.

Much of the code is Octave compatible.

For performance and general usability, further work should probably be in porting to Python unless there is a cepstral to LPC function easy off the shelf. 
Your choice.

`Main.m` is the only program to run.

Let me know if this is something you're interested in.
